## Features

- Digital Signature Algorithms
- Hashing
- Public Key Exchange
- Data Structures like Bloom Filters & Radix Tree

## Digital Signature Algorithms

### ed25519

`secret_key -> secret_key`

`public_key: secret_key -> public_key`

`sign: message, secret_key -> signature`

`verify: message, public_key, signature -> bool`

## Public Key Exchange

### x25519

`secret_key -> secret_key`

`public_key: secret_key -> public_key`

`shared_key: public_key, secret_key -> shared_secret`

## Data Structures

### Bloom Filter

### Radix Tree

**Structs**

`RadixTree<K, V>`: Represents the radix tree, generic over `K` for key and `V` for value.
- `nodes`: `HashMap` storing the nodes of the tree, each identified by a 32-byte array.
- `parents`: `HashMap` tracking the parent of each node.
- `root`: 32-byte array representing the root node.

`RadixNode<K, V>`: Represents a single node within the `RadixTree`.
- `children`: `BTreeMap` mapping keys to child node hashes.
- `key`: `Vec<K>` representing the node's key.
- `value`: Optional `V` holding the value associated with the key.

**Methods**

`new() -> Self`: Creates a new instance of `RadixTree`.

`insert<I>(&mut self, key: I, value: V)`: Inserts a key-value pair into the tree.
- `key`: Iterable of type `K`.
- `value`: Value to be associated with the key.

`rehash(&mut self, child_hash: &[u8; 32])`: Updates the hash of a child node.
- `child_hash`: Hash of the child node.

`remove<I>(&mut self, key: I) -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>>`: Removes a key-value pair.
- `key`: Iterable of type `K`.

`search<I>(&self, key: I) -> Option<&V>`: Searches for a value by key.
- `key`: Iterable of type `K`.

`split_node(&mut self, node_hash: [u8; 32], split_position: usize) -> Result<([u8; 32], [u8; 32]), Box<dyn Error>>`: Splits a node at a specified position.
- `node_hash`: Hash of the node to split.
- `split_position`: Position to split the node.

## Future

- üîí Encryption
- üèó Accumulation
- üìú Commitment Schemes
- üòé Zero-knowledge Proof Schemes
