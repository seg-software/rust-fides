## Author

- Roy R. O. Okello: [Email](mailto:royokello@protonmail.com) & [GitHub](https://github.com/royokello)

## Features

- Digital Signature Algorithms
- Hashing
- Public Key Exchange
- Data Structures

## Usage

### Installation

- From Crates by adding `fides = "3.2.0"` to `Cargo.toml` under `[dependencies]`

### Digital Signature Algorithms

#### ed25519

`secret_key -> secret_key`

`public_key: secret_key -> public_key`

`sign: message, secret_key -> signature`

`verify: message, public_key, signature -> bool`

### Public Key Exchange

#### x25519

`secret_key -> secret_key`

`public_key: secret_key -> public_key`

`shared_key: public_key, secret_key -> shared_secret`

### Data Structures

#### Bloom Filter

#### merkle tree

`root: hasher, leaves -> hash`
